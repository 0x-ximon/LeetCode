* Principle of Recursion
Simply, Recursion is an approach to solving problems using a function that calls itself as a subroutine. The recursion call continues until it reaches a point where the subproblem can be solved without further recursion. A recursive function should have the following properties so that it does not result in an infinite loop:

1. A simple /base case (or cases)/ â€” a terminating scenario that does not use recursion to produce an answer.
2. A set of rules, also known as /recurrence relation/ that reduces all other cases towards the base case.

* Complexity Analysis
Given a recursion algorithm, its time complexity \(\)
